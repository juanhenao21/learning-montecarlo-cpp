Learning Monte Carlo in CPP.

The algorithm algorithm has three goals.

The first goal is to read a magnetite data file that contains the position of the atoms, the neighboors of each atom and the interaction between the atom and their neighboors.

Then, create a CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) element to store the number of neighboors of each atom and the interaction between each atom and their neighboors.

Finally, with the stored elements and the spin of the atoms is calculated the energy of the system.
